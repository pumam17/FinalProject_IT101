<h6>Problem Statement:</h6>
<p>You have been asked to write a payroll program for the Lick2theStickLollipops Company.  Lick2theStickLollipops Company is located in Cincinnati, Ohio and has employees that live in Ohio, Indiana, and Kentucky.  The company has both salaried (management) and hourly employees.  The application should assist the payroll clerk in doing her weekly (52 times a year) payroll.</p>
<p>The application must allow the clerk to state if the payroll is a salaried employee or an hourly employee.  Based on that selection, the clerk will gain access to the proper form to enter the necessary first and last name of the employee and the necessary data for each type of employee to provide the necessary totals of:  Gross Pay, FICA, State Taxes, Federal Taxes, and Net Pay.</p>
<p>Daily Total of Gross Pay and Net Pay that combine both Salaried and Hourly Employees are to be viewed when requested (Button on Main Form) in a Messagebox. </p>
<h6>Gross Pay for Salaried Employees:</h6>
<p>The clerk will provide the yearly salary of the employee on the form.  Gross Pay will be determined based on the salary divided by the number of payrolls per year</p>
<h6>Gross Pay for Hourly Employees:</h6>
<p>The clerk will provide the hours worked for the pay period and their hourly wage.  Gross pay will be determined based on the hours worked and the hourly wage.  If the employee works over 40 hours in a week, they will be paid time and a half for all hours over 40.</p>
